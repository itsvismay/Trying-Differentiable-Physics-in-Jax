# Trying-Differentiable-Physics-in-Jax
Links to a bunch of Jupyter/Colab notebooks that show my steps on 
1. Learning to use jax and creating a simple mass-spring system
2. Speeding up the physics code using `scan` and `jit`
3. Using differentiable physics to optimize the mass-spring system's physics properties
4. Using differentiable physics to optimize a mass-spring system's physics properties and even start-pose
